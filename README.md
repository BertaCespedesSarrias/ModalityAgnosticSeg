# ModalityAgnosticSeg

This project leverages Anatomix weights to fine-tune a UNet on cardiac datasets in single- and multi-modality settings. In the case of multi-modality there are two approaches used: partial-loss and multi-head prediction.

Anatomix framework can be visited at: https://github.com/neel-dey/anatomix.
